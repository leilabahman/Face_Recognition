# Face Detection and Recognition

In this repo I will be using the Python Face Recognition library (the world’s simplest face recognition library for python and command line)

Built using dlib’s state-of-the-art face recognition
built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.
